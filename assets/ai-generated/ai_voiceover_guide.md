## Script Preparation & Formatting

### Script Format Guidelines

#### Formatting Standards
```
[SCENE 1 - INTRODUCTION]
[0:00-0:05]

[Tone: Warm and welcoming]
[Pacing: Moderate]
[Emphasis: "ApplyforUs" and "AI-powered"]

Welcome to ApplyforUs, the AI-powered job search platform that works while
you sleep. I'm going to show you how to land more interviews with less effort.

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[SCENE 2 - THE PROBLEM]
[0:05-0:12]

[Tone: Empathetic]
[Pacing: Slightly faster]

We know job searching is exhausting. (pause) Hundreds of applications.
(pause) Endless forms. (pause) And barely any responses.
```

#### Notation System

**Pacing Indicators**
- `(pause)` - Brief natural pause (0.5-1 second)
- `(longer pause)` - Extended pause (1-2 seconds)
- `(beat)` - Quick pause for emphasis (0.25 seconds)
- `[PAUSE: X seconds]` - Specific timed pause

**Emphasis Indicators**
- *italics* - Slight emphasis
- **bold** - Strong emphasis
- ALL CAPS - Avoid (use bold instead)
- Underline - Primary focus word/phrase

**Pronunciation Guides**
- Use phonetic spelling in brackets: ApplyforUs [apply-for-us]
- AI [A-I, not "ay"] - spell out individual letters
- Technical terms: Include pronunciation

**Tone Indicators**
- [Excited]
- [Empathetic]
- [Serious]
- [Playful]
- [Confident]
- [Curious]

**Delivery Notes**
- [Smile voice] - Sound like you're smiling
- [Rising inflection] - Question or intrigue
- [Falling inflection] - Statement or finality
- [Faster] - Increase pace
- [Slower] - Decrease pace

---

### Script Writing Best Practices

#### Sentence Structure
- **Keep sentences short**: 10-15 words ideal
- **Use active voice**: "AI applies for you" not "Applications are submitted by AI"
- **Conversational language**: Write how people speak
- **Avoid jargon**: Or explain technical terms
- **Natural rhythm**: Read aloud while writing

#### Pacing & Timing

**Words Per Minute (WPM) Guidelines**
- **Slow pace**: 120-140 WPM (technical, detailed)
- **Moderate pace**: 150-170 WPM (standard explainers)
- **Fast pace**: 180-200 WPM (energetic promos)
- **Very fast pace**: 210+ WPM (social media, ads)

**Timing Calculation**
```
Script Length Formula:
Total Words ÷ WPM × 60 = Total Seconds

Example:
300 words ÷ 160 WPM × 60 = 112.5 seconds (~2 minutes)
```

#### Breathing & Pauses

**Natural Breath Points**
- End of sentences (always)
- Between major thoughts
- Before important information
- After questions
- During transitions

**Strategic Pauses**
- Build anticipation
- Allow information to sink in
- Emphasize key points
- Create dramatic effect
- Match visual transitions

---

## Recording Direction & Session Management

### Pre-Session Preparation

#### Voice Talent Prep
- **Hydration**: Drink water, avoid dairy/caffeine before recording
- **Warm-up**: Vocal exercises, tongue twisters (10-15 minutes)
- **Script Review**: Read through entire script 2-3 times
- **Question Clarification**: Understand context and goals
- **Reference Review**: Listen to style examples

#### Director/Producer Prep
- **Script Marked**: Pronunciation guides, emphasis notes
- **Reference Tracks**: Example voiceovers in target style
- **Visual Materials**: Video draft or storyboard (if available)
- **Timing Requirements**: Exact duration needs
- **Tone/Style Brief**: Clear direction document

---

### Recording Session Direction

#### Session Flow
1. **Mic Check & Levels**: Test and set recording levels
2. **Warm-up Take**: Practice run, no pressure
3. **Full Take 1**: Complete script, natural delivery
4. **Full Take 2**: Complete script, alternative read
5. **Full Take 3**: Complete script, different energy
6. **Pickups**: Specific sections that need adjusting
7. **Alt Versions**: Different pacing or emphasis options
8. **Wild Lines**: Additional phrases for editing flexibility

#### Direction Language

**Effective Feedback**
- "Let's try that with more energy"
- "Can you slow down slightly on this section?"
- "Emphasize 'automatic' more strongly"
- "Smile through this part - make it warmer"
- "That was great, let's do one more for safety"

**Avoid**
- Vague feedback: "Make it better"
- Negative only: "That wasn't good"
- Over-direction: Too many notes at once
- Comparison: "Do it like [famous person]"

#### Common Adjustments

**Energy Too Low**
- "Stand up while recording"
- "Imagine you're telling a friend exciting news"
- "Add more smile to your voice"

**Too Fast**
- "Imagine you're teaching someone"
- "Let the words breathe"
- "Slow down 10-20%"

**Too Formal**
- "Make it conversational"
- "How would you explain this to your friend?"
- "Relax and be yourself"

**Unclear Diction**
- "Over-articulate consonants"
- "Crisp 'T' sounds"
- "Don't let words run together"
