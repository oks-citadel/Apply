## Prompt Optimization Tips

### For Midjourney

**Key Parameters**

- `--v 6` - Version 6 (latest)
- `--style raw` - More literal interpretation
- `--s 250` - Stylization (0-1000, 250 = moderate)
- `--q 2` - Quality (1 = fast, 2 = high quality)

**Effective Patterns**
1. Start with subject/scene
2. Add style descriptors
3. Specify colors with hex codes
4. Define composition
5. Add mood/atmosphere
6. Include technical details (lighting, camera angle)

**Example**
```
/imagine modern office workspace, laptop on minimal desk, natural window light,
professional photography style, shallow depth of field, purple accents #8B5CF6,

6. Iterate until satisfied (typically 3-5 iterations)

### Common Adjustments
- **Too busy**: Add "minimal", "clean", "simple"
- **Wrong colors**: Specify hex codes explicitly
- **Poor composition**: Define layout and negative space
- **Wrong style**: Add specific style references and examples
- **Inconsistent**: Use seed/reference images for consistency
