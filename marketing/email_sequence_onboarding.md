**Subject:** [First Name], need help getting started?

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you created an ApplyforUs account but haven't completed your profile yet.

Stuck on something? Common questions:

**"What resume format should I use?"**
PDF or DOCX works great. Don't worry about formatting - our AI optimizes it automatically.

**"How do I set the right preferences?"**
Start broad. You can narrow down after seeing initial matches. Most users start with 3-5 target roles.

**"Will employers know I'm using automation?"**
Nope! Applications look identical to manual ones. We use human-like patterns.

## Email 3: First Application Tips (Day 3)

**Subject:** 🎯 How to get 3x more interview requests

**Preview Text:** Small tweaks to your strategy = big results

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You've been using ApplyforUs for a few days now. How's it going?

I wanted to share some data-backed tips that help our users get 3x more interview requests:

**Tip #1: Apply Early in the Week**

Our analysis of 500,000 applications shows:

Best days to apply:
- 🥇 Tuesday (23% higher response rate)
- 🥈 Wednesday (18% higher)
- 🥉 Monday (12% higher)

Worst day:
- 😞 Friday (22% LOWER response rate)

**Action:** In your settings, schedule applications for Tuesday-Thursday mornings.
[Adjust Schedule]

**Tip #2: Optimize for ATS Systems**

78% of resumes get rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems before humans see them.

Our AI automatically:
✓ Incorporates relevant keywords
✓ Formats for ATS compatibility
✓ Highlights matching skills

But you can help by:
- Using standard section names ("Work Experience" not "My Journey")
- Avoiding tables and text boxes
- Including industry-specific keywords

[Run ATS Compatibility Check]

**Tip #3: Quality AND Quantity**

Average job seeker: 3-5 applications per week, generic resumes, 5% response rate

ApplyforUs users: 50-100 applications per week, customized resumes, 23% response rate

The secret? Smart matching + AI optimization + volume

**Action:** Review your match criteria. Too narrow = missed opportunities.
[Review Match Settings]

**Tip #4: Track and Follow Up**

68% of job seekers never follow up after applying.

Set follow-up reminders:
- 1 week after application: Check status
- 2 weeks after interview: Thank you + check in
- 1 month: Final follow-up before moving on

[Set Up Follow-Up Reminders]

**Your Stats So Far:**

- Applications submitted: [X]
- Match accuracy: [X]%
- Applications in progress: [X]
- Next batch scheduled: [Date/Time]

[View Full Dashboard]

**Real Results:**

💬 "I adjusted my schedule to Tuesday mornings and my response rate doubled!" - Priya P.

💬 "The ATS check caught formatting issues I didn't know existed." - James K.

**Coming Up:**

In 4 days, I'll send you advanced features most users don't know about (but should!).

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Keep applying smarter!
