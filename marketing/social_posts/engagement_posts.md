## Post 3: Controversial Take

**LinkedIn:**
Unpopular opinion: Cover letters are still important in 2024.

I know everyone says "recruiters don't read them."

But our data from 100,000+ applications shows:

Applications WITH cover letters: 31% response rate
Applications WITHOUT: 19% response rate

That's a 63% increase in responses.

The real problem isn't that cover letters don't work.
It's that they take too long to write.

Change my mind 👇

What's your take on cover letters?

#JobSearch #Debate #CareerAdvice

**Twitter:**
Hot take: Cover letters still matter.

Our data:
- With cover letter: 31% response rate
- Without: 19% response rate

The problem isn't effectiveness.
It's the time investment.

## Post 12: Weekend Reflection

**LinkedIn:**
Weekend reflection: What's one thing you learned about yourself during your job search?

For me, I learned that rejection isn't personal - it's just part of the process.

Every "no" was either:
- Wrong timing
- Wrong fit
- Wrong role
- Or brought me closer to the right "yes"

What have you learned about yourself?

Share below - let's end the week on a reflective note 👇
