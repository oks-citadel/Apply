**Maker Comment:**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Founder Name], maker of ApplyforUs.

I built this after watching my partner spend 6 months on a brutal job search. Despite being incredibly talented, she was spending 25+ hours per week just on applications - copying the same information into different forms, tailoring resumes by hand, getting rejected by bots.

I kept thinking: "There has to be a better way."

So we built ApplyforUs. The goal was simple: automate the repetitive, low-value work so job seekers can focus on what actually leads to offers - building relationships, preparing for interviews, and developing skills.

We're live today and would love your feedback!

**What I'm most excited to hear:**
1. Does this solve a real pain point for you?
2. What features would make this more valuable?
3. Any concerns about AI handling applications?

**Roadmap preview:**
- Mobile app (Q1 2025)
- Salary negotiation coaching
- Network building tools
- Company culture matching

Thanks for checking us out! Happy to answer any questions in the comments.

Let's make job searching work for job seekers, not against them.

## Reddit Launch Post (r/jobs, r/cscareerquestions, etc.)

**Title:** I built an AI tool that automates job applications - would love feedback

**Post:**

Hey everyone,

I just launched ApplyforUs and wanted to share it with this community since job searching is something we all deal with.

**Background:**
My partner spent 6 months on a brutal job search last year. Despite being talented and qualified, she was spending 25+ hours per week on repetitive application tasks - copying information into forms, tailoring resumes, answering the same screening questions over and over.

It was soul-crushing to watch. So I built ApplyforUs to automate the busy work.

**What it does:**
- Applies to relevant jobs automatically across 50+ job boards
- Customizes your resume for each position using AI
- Generates personalized cover letters
- Tracks all applications in one dashboard
- Helps you prep for interviews

**Beta results:**
We had 5,000+ beta testers over the past 6 months:
- Average user got 5x more interview requests
- Saved 20+ hours per week on average
- 78% higher ATS pass rate with optimized resumes

**Why I'm posting here:**
1. This community has given me tons of job search advice over the years - wanted to give back
2. Looking for honest feedback on the product
3. Offering free trials to anyone interested

**Common questions I get:**

*"Will employers know I used automation?"*
No. Applications look identical to manual ones. We use human-like patterns and timing.

*"Isn't this just spam?"*
No. We use smart matching to ensure relevance. Quality over quantity. You have full control over what gets applied to.

*"Is this ethical?"*
I think so. Companies use ATS to auto-reject candidates. This levels the playing field. Happy to discuss in comments though.

**Try it out:**
Free 14-day trial at applyforus.com (no credit card required)

Would genuinely love feedback from this community. What would make this more useful? What concerns do you have?

Thanks for reading!

**Edit:** Wow, thanks for all the questions! I'll keep responding throughout the day.

**Edit 2:** For those asking about pricing - $29/month for unlimited applications after the free trial. Free plan available for 10 apps/month.
