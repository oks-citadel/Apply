### Thread Ad 1: Educational Content
**Tweet 1:**
Why you're not getting interviews (and how to fix it) 🧵

I've helped 50,000+ job seekers. Here are the 5 biggest mistakes I see:

**Tweet 2:**
1/ You're not applying to enough jobs

Most people apply to 5-10 jobs per week.
Top performers? 50-100+.

You need volume. That's where ApplyforUs automation helps.

**Tweet 3:**
2/ Your resume isn't ATS-optimized

78% of resumes are rejected by software before humans see them.

You need the right keywords, formatting, and structure. Our AI handles this automatically.

**Tweet 4:**
3/ You're not customizing applications

Generic resumes get generic results (ghosting).

ApplyforUs AI customizes your resume for every job. More relevant = more responses.

**Tweet 5:**
4/ You're spending time on the wrong activities

Applying to jobs manually: Low ROI
Networking & interview prep: High ROI

Automate the low-value work. Focus on high-value activities.

**Tweet 6:**
5/ You're not tracking effectively

Lost applications = missed follow-ups = lost opportunities.

One dashboard for everything. Never miss a chance to follow up.
