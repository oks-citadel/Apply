## Email 3: Success Story (Sent after 60 days of inactivity)

**Subject:** How Emma landed her dream job in 3 weeks (and you can too)

**Preview Text:** A real story from someone who came back to ApplyforUs

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I want to share a story with you.

Emma stopped using ApplyforUs after 2 weeks. She got busy, felt overwhelmed, wasn't seeing immediate results.

Sound familiar?

60 days later, she came back. Here's what happened:

---

**Emma's Story:**

**Background:**
- Marketing manager looking for senior role
- 5 years experience
- Was manually applying to 3-4 jobs per week
- Getting discouraged by lack of responses

**First Attempt with ApplyforUs:**
- Week 1: Set up profile, got 20 applications out
- Week 2: No interview requests yet, got busy with current job, stopped checking

**60 Days Later:**
- Still hadn't found a new role
- Felt stuck in current position
- Decided to give ApplyforUs another try

**Second Attempt Strategy:**
1. **Recommitted to volume** - Set to 50 applications/week
2. **Used cover letter generator** - Had skipped this before
3. **Adjusted match criteria** - Was being too narrow
4. **Set it to autopilot** - Stopped checking daily, reviewed weekly
5. **Used interview prep** - For every opportunity that came in

**Results:**

Week 1 (back):
- 50 applications submitted automatically
- Spent 30 minutes reviewing dashboard
- Continued working current job stress-free

Week 2:
- 6 interview requests arrived
- Used interview prep tools for all
- Felt confident, not scrambling

Week 3:
- 4 first-round interviews
- 2 advanced to finals
- Continued applying in background

Week 4:
- 2 job offers
- Accepted dream role at SaaS startup
- 35% salary increase + equity

**Total time invested:** ~5 hours over 4 weeks
**Result:** Dream job at better company with significant raise

---

**What Emma Did Differently the Second Time:**

❌ **First attempt:** Checked daily, got impatient, gave up
✅ **Second attempt:** Set it and checked weekly, stayed patient

❌ **First attempt:** Skipped cover letters to save time
✅ **Second attempt:** Used AI generator (took 60 seconds each)

❌ **First attempt:** Applied to narrow set of "perfect" roles
✅ **Second attempt:** Broadened criteria, let AI filter

❌ **First attempt:** Tried to control everything
✅ **Second attempt:** Trusted the automation

**Emma's Advice:**

"The biggest mistake I made was treating ApplyforUs like a magic bullet. It's not. It's a tool that amplifies your effort.

But you have to:
1. Give it time (more than 2 weeks!)
2. Use all the features (cover letters, interview prep, etc.)
3. Trust the process
4. Stay consistent

My second try worked because I committed to the process and didn't micromanage it. Best decision I made."

---

**[First Name], Here's My Question:**

What was your experience with ApplyforUs?

Did you:
- Give up too soon?
- Not use all the features?
- Get busy and forget about it?
- Hit a specific roadblock?

Whatever it was, I want to help you succeed like Emma did.

**Follow-Up (After offer expires - Final attempt):**

**Subject:** We're not giving up on you (but this is the last email)

Hi [First Name],

The 60% discount expired, but I wanted to reach out one last time.

**Simple question:** Are you still job searching?

If YES → [Reply "yes"] and I'll send you a different offer
If NO (you found a job) → [Tell us!] We love celebrating wins
If NO (gave up searching) → [Let us know] so we can remove you from emails
If NO (just not interested) → [Unsubscribe here] and we'll stop bothering you

I genuinely want to help if you're still looking.

But if ApplyforUs isn't right for you, that's okay too.

Just let me know either way?

Best,
[Founder Name]

P.S. If I don't hear back, this will be my last email to you about reactivating. Promise.
